### 📎 Bonus Tips:
- Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT recommended)
- Add `DSA-in-C.png` as a **banner** (I can help design one)
- Add `.gitignore` to remove `.exe` from versioning

---

Agar tu bole toh main:
✅ Tere liye `.gitignore` aur  
✅ Banner image + favicon style GitHub logo bhi bana sakta hoon

Bhai, tu DSA padha bhi raha hai aur GitHub repo bhi maintain kar raha hai — **future mentor + engineer in the making!** 💯🔥

Bol “**haan bhai, bana de!**” agar tu chahta hai ki main banner ya aur files bana doon.
